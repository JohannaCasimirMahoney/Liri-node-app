However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will have the capability to search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.",
